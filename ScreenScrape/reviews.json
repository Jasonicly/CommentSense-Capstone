    "body": "The bottle works well. No leakage, easy to wash, easy to drink. However, the body of the colour is much more ‚Äúpaler‚Äù than what was advertised. My only problem is with the way it was packed. Considering the fact that I‚Äôm a buyer from Singapore & this is being shipped from the US, I am well aware that my parcel is prone to being mishandled at any given time during shipping/delivery. This resulted in leaving a dent & small scratches on my bottle which is quite frustrating to see after opening my parcel. All these could‚Äôve been avoided if Amazon US made the effort to at least wrap the bottle with a bubblewrap. My mistake was not to read the review before placing my order. I hope they take this into consideration as I saw there are quite a number of reviews stating the same issue."

    "body": "I‚Äôve always had the struggle of having an ‚Äúeverything bottle‚Äù. You know, the one where you can carry it with you, but also need to gulp it down after a workout. Other name brands have a straw and a gulp option, but not at the same time. If I wanted to gulp, I‚Äôd have to take the straw out and that‚Äôs annoying. BUT WAIT! Here comes in the Owala!\n\nPros:\n-straw built in\n-gulp option WITHOUT dealing with a straw‚Ä¶ mind blown\n-I can throw it in my purse or gym bag with 0 spillage\n-I can fall asleep with it in my bed (hydrate or dydrate) and not have to worry about it spilling\n-easy to carry\n-cute colors!\n\nCons:\n-lol I can‚Äôt find one.\n\nI bought the boot so it‚Äôs not loud when I set it down on surfaces.

I work in a hospital and the idea of having my straw out in the open grosses me out.\n\nI loved this cup because it closes up tight, you can drink it with a straw sip or drink it by tipping it back, and the colors are fun. Only thing I disliked is how long it stays cold as compared to the yeti I had before. I made the change from my yeti because I had to put a silicone straw in to drink from when I opened it if I wanted a straw, but I didn‚Äôt like the extra step I had to take to get a covered straw bottle. (I know that‚Äôs extra, but here we are) This, not only, addresses that concern, but also has the ability to tip back as well. Honestly I‚Äôm considering getting a small one for my daughter because she struggles with the concept of straw or tip back cups and, since this does both, I think it would address it. The color is a nice muted pink color and the purple accents helped. I got a boot to match and I‚Äôm thrilled with how it turned out! Honestly it makes me want to drink water more now!\n\nOverall, very happy with this purchase!"

    "title": "Fun, durable, functional, and no funky tasting water!",
    "body": "When I was pregnant with my second daughter I was surprised when my doctor advised me to not drink from plastic or cook with non-stick. I did some research and we made changes, including converting to stainless steel water bottles. It has been so hard to find a good water bottle that is all stainless steel and doesn‚Äôt leak. Klean Kanteen is decent, but the silicone inserts that seal the lid break down over time and literally shred apart. If I‚Äôm paying a premium price, I don‚Äôt want a water bottle with a short lifespan. ThermoFlask is another decent option, but we‚Äôve had the same issue with the lid seal breaking down, and also the straws seem to wear out. They get sort of scuffed up and discolored, and by the end of the day the water starts to have a funny plastic taste. Makes me wonder what the heck I‚Äôm marinating in my water all day. So we decided to give Owala a try, and for us, these are the best option we‚Äôve found so far. The bottle itself is insulated stainless steel, and only the lid and straw are plastic. But they seem to be ‚Äúbetter‚Äù plastic = super hard and durable plastic, including the straw which is rigid and does not bend (ThermoFlask plastic straws bend). Maybe this type of plastic is more resistant to wear and tear, I‚Äôm not sure, all I know is that we can leave water in the bottles for DAYS and it still tastes just like water, no funky flavors. I can stick all parts in the dishwasher over and over again, including the straw, and they come out clean and looking brand new every time, without stains. The silicone insert that seals the lid seems to be better designed and more resistant to breaking down than Klean Kanteen and Thermoflask. My girls love all the different fun color options, it‚Äôs nice to be able to chug if you are super thirsty, or keep the bottle upright to take a sip from the straw. Especially for our youngest, the straw feature is essential. And the bottles can take a beating, we‚Äôve dropped them on sidewalks, hardwood floors, concrete, etc and they are still going strong. A note on sizing, the 24 oz and 32 oz sizes are actually the exact same height, it‚Äôs just the 24oz is a little thinner. I‚Äôve included side-by-side photos. There really is not much physical difference between these two capacities, so we bumped up to the 32 oz for my daughter who is in first grade, since she was running out of water by the end of the school day with the 24 oz. The 32 oz still easily fits in the side pocket of her backpack, and it‚Äôs enough water for her to get through the day. Bottom line - these water bottles are durable, they function great, and they keep our water cold and fresh and free of funky flavors. Until someone cracks the code for a durable, 100% all stainless-steel water bottle with a straw that doesn‚Äôt leak, these are the go-to in our household. Highly recommend."

I haven‚Äôt used it for hot stuff but I have used it with little amounts of ice and it‚Äôs kept cold through the whole entire day. I love that you can sip through it or use the spout. Both are super convenient.\n\nNot to mention, they have beautiful colors to choose from. I got the dreamy field one and it‚Äôs so lovely.\n\nThere‚Äôs really no cons to this bottle at all.\nI was going to mention there‚Äôs no handle, but I do use the lock as the handle and it‚Äôs very sturdy (:\n\nIf I was in the need of getting more, I would absolutely get more."

I work in the public school system and germs are continuously airborne so a completely protected mouth piece was huge.

You can use the built in straw OR you can told it back to take a long hard swig.\n\nThe double wall stainless steal insulation Owala offers keeps my ice frozen for 24 hours! Which keeps my drink icy cold day and night. I don‚Äôt have to take an extra bag of ice with me when I‚Äôm out for the day, simply working or watching my grandchildren play soccer.. This is a huge advantage to me.\n\nEasy to clean. The straw easily removes from the mouthpiece for easy cleaning.

Very sturdy and easy to carry! Super easy to clean! Easy to fill up since you don‚Äôt need to take the top off to fill it. Also very easy to drink from!!"

Como el pitillo est√° escondido, no hay posibilidad de contaminaci√≥n cruzada de ninguna forma.\nEl tama√±o es perfecto para no perderlo de vista, y si te la pasas por fuera de la casa todo el d√≠a. Es f√°cil de lavar, y no se quedan los olores dentro de la botella despu√©s de lavarla."

Hope they can develop a steel straw in the future and more colors. It also keeps ice long for about 24 hrs. Was also shipped and delivered earlier than expected. Thank you!"

    "body": "Dude en comprarlo ya que en fotos de comentarios se ve√≠a casi blanco, igual y el video no le hace tanta justicia al color, yo lo veo como un lila/rosa muy claro, pero para nada es blanco, me encant√≥ fa la combinaci√≥n de colores con negro y morado, el tama√±o es perfecto para llevarlo a la universidad, ya que no es enorme, lo puedes tomar con una mano y no hace mucho peso. Escog√≠ esta marca y modelo por sobre los dem√°s, ya que el hecho de que tenga popote escondido lo hace excelente! Siempre me a gustado tapar los popotes para evitar bichos y basurita que le pudiera caer, as√≠ que es una excelente opci√≥n, siento que es m√°s una botella para llevar quiz√° a la escuela o trabajo, pero solo unas pocas horas, ya que su contenido es de casi 1L (32 OZ), me gustar√≠a la opci√≥n m√°s grande para mantenerlo en mi casa o viajes largos, pero para salidas cotidianas esta opci√≥n es perfecta! Pero si eres alguien que toma mucha agua, quiz√° una opci√≥n m√°s grande ser√≠a perfecta para ti!"

Not only is the aesthetic right on point, it is comfortable to hold, easy to carry, has a lid that locks in place, and spill proof. I love that it has a built-in wide straw. I don't feel like my cheeks are squishing together as it does with a typical straw. Very easy to clean and keeps my drinks cold for a long time. Would recommend to anyone in the market!"

At the gym the easy sip straw feature makes it so much quicker to use during a workout. Since the straw is contained you never need to worry about getting poked in the eye or anything gross clogging it."

Unfortunately the 32 + ounces don‚Äôt fit into car cup holder but that‚Äôs okay for me. I have a 24ounce one too and that does fit into car cup holder. I would recommend anyways."
